# NexumStager
Generates powershell droppers/stagers for windows executables. Obfuscation is updated every once in a while. Fully undetectable.

## Installation
- None, just run the main executable

## Usage
- The tool is interactive, everything should be explained clear enough

Note: the dropped file touches the disk, the dropper/stager DOES NOT make your payload FUD by itself, this script may be useful during post-exploitation or for social engineering porpuses as powershell is more versatile (e.g. you can use it in vba macros or embed it inside other code very easily.

This tool is not meant for malicious porpuses but just for demonstration and educational porpuses. I do not take any responsibility for your usage of this tool.
